# Online Library System (React + Vite + Tailwind CSS)

This project is a single-page application (SPA) built using **React** to simulate a basic online library system. It demonstrates component-based architecture, client-side routing, advanced state management, and form validation.

## Features

The application provides a fully functional interface for browsing, searching, viewing details, and adding new books.

* **Vite Setup:** The project is bootstrapped using Vite, as required.
* **Client-Side:** Utilizes `react-route-dom` for navigation, including dynamic routes and a 404 handler.
* **Centralized State Management:** Uses **Redux Toolkit** to manage the global list of books.
* **Search & Filtering:** Allows filtering books by dynamic URL category parameters and real-time search by title or author.
* **Form Handling:** Implements a controlled form for adding new books, complete with client-side validation.

## UI & UX

* Fully responsive interface
* Smooth transitions

## Technologies Used
